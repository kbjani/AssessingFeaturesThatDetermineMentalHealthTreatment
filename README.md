# AssessingFeaturesThatDetermineMentalHealthTreatment
The objective of this project is to classify and predict whether a person sought mental health treatment by building a decision tree model and comparing its results to k-means clusters. We aim to apply machine learning techniques to understand which features are most closely associated with seeking mental health treatment. These insights could support future efforts to improve access to and attitudes towards mental health resources in the tech industry and beyond.
